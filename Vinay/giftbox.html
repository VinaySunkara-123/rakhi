    <p>This photo takes me back to Raksha Bandhan 2021 — a day when my sister tied a rakhi with love and we laughed over childhood memories. A special moment that stays close to my heart.</p>

<p>2022 brought us even closer. My sister tied the rakhi with so much love and care, and we exchanged gifts that truly spoke from the heart. The laughter, the teasing, and the quiet bonding made it a day to remember forever.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #9C27B0;">Raksha Bandhan 2023 &#x1F496;</h3>
<p>Raksha Bandhan 2023 was filled with beautiful surprises. We planned a small celebration at home with decorations, sweets, and smiles all around. My sister’s rakhi this year was handmade, and it felt so special — a symbol of love that words can’t describe.</p>

         <h3 style="color: #3F51B5;">Raksha Bandhan 2024 &#x1F496;</h3>

         <p>In 2024, my sister couldn’t tie rakhi because she was living far away. Even though we weren’t together, the bond remained strong — we shared memories over a video call and sent virtual hugs. Distance couldn’t break our connection.

         <p style="color:#6A1B9A; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;"> As the years go by, memories may fade — but the love between a brother and sister remains eternal. Each Raksha Bandhan we spent together is a precious thread in the fabric of my life, woven with laughter, care, and unspoken understanding. <br><br> Even in moments apart, I feel your presence in every smile, every thought, and every silent prayer. No distance can ever weaken the bond we share. <br><br> Here's to all the beautiful memories we've made — and all the new ones yet to come. <br><br> With love, forever and always... ❤️🎁🧵 </p>
